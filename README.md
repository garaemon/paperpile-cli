# paperpile

An **unofficial** command-line tool to upload, list, and delete references in [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/).

Paperpile has no public API. This tool works by reverse-engineering the web app's internal endpoints.

## Installation

Requires Go 1.26+.

```bash
go install github.com/garaemon/paperpile@latest
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/garaemon/paperpile.git
cd paperpile
make build
```

The binary is named `paperpile`.

## Authentication

Paperpile uses session cookies for authentication. This CLI obtains the session via a bookmarklet flow.

```bash
paperpile login
```

1. The CLI starts a local HTTP server and opens a setup page in your browser.
2. Drag the **"Paperpile: Send to CLI"** bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar (one-time setup).
3. Navigate to [app.paperpile.com](https://app.paperpile.com/) and log in.
4. Click the bookmarklet. It extracts the session cookie and sends it to the CLI.
5. The CLI verifies the session and saves it to `~/.config/paperpile/config.yaml`.

When the session expires, run `paperpile login` again and click the bookmarklet.
